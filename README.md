# ASIC Image to Text generator with GUI
 
I hope you like my first project on GitHub!

It's an simple ASIC image to text converter made with python.
You can either use the python scrypt or download the .exe file in the release section.

Credits to https://github.com/RameshAditya/asciify for the image converting part
